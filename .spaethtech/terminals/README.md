# Terminals

## PhpStorm

This configuration will likely work on any of the IntelliJ-based IDEs, but PHPStorm makes the most sense for UCRM Plugin
development.

Navigate to the correct area of settings:

```
File | Settings | Tools | Terminal
```

_The below options append the following to the `PATH` environment variable in any newly executed Terminal in PhpStorm._
- `{PROJECT_DIR}\bin`
- `{PROJECT_DIR}\.spaethtech\bin`
- `{PROJECT_DIR}\.spaethtech\vendor\bin`
- `{PROJECT_DIR}\vendor\bin`

Choose one of the following, depending upon your preferred terminal.

> _**IMPORTANT**: Currently, PhpStorm's Terminal settings are application-wide and configuring any of the following
> will apply to ALL projects._
>
> _Due to this limitation, the commands below include a fallback in the case of a missing terminal folder or script._
